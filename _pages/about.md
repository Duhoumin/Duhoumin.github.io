I'm a doctoral student in Department of Physics, Renmin University of China.

The purpose of starting this blog is to collect some notes and materials during my studies and research, especially in condensed matter physics. There are so many topics in this field, if only focus on theoretical aspects, in my opinion, these can be roughly classified into two categories: the one is "the triditional", say for example heavy-fermion systems, the other is "the modern", say for example topological matter states. Actually, I have little knowledge and feeling about "the modern", the possible reason might be that my advisor out of date(laughing), which influences me, in addition, my lazy bones. On the other hand, as for my physics taste, I particularly like old problems which have a long history as there is a magic attraction.As a result, during my Ph. D.,I will tackle some problems related to quantum impurity and heavy-fermion systems.
